About the C# Wrapper
--------------------
The C# wrapper was written to be used for MonoGame's desktop platforms. However,
this is written in a way that can be used for any general Mono application.

The wrapper will include bindings for the following libraries:
- SDL2
- SDL2_image
- SDL2_mixer
- SDL2_ttf

Note that SDL2# will not provide every single SDL2 function. This is due to
limitations in the C# language that would cause major conflicts with the native
SDL2 library and its extensions.
